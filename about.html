    <h3>Annual Hackathon</br>
    2016 Edition</h3>
<body>
    <p>
The annual BluKat Hackathon was established in 2004, and has since then been involved in the building of  problem identification and solving skills of school students worldwide.</br>
BluKat's mission is to spread the hacker ethos to every student on the planet; to cultivate communities where aspiring hackers have the opportunity to learn, build, and share their creations with the world.
In the hackathon, participants are given some time to try and solve a problem(not all are technical).</br>
At BluKat, we hope to:</br>    -Provide an opportunity for participants to learn something new.</br>
   - Provide a space and a time for participants to make headway on problems they are interested in.

</p> This year's event will be held at the Galana Plaza, sixth floor, along galana road, Nairobi from 18th to 19th January. Time is from 6.30 pm to 9 pm. Open to all. Entry is free.</br>
We hope  see you there.
